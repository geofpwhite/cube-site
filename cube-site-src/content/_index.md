Rotating Cube using ansipixels Library

![](cube.gif)

Not a whole lot to describe, honestly. I implemented a few shading algorithms that I didn't fully understand and played with the values to get them right.
I mainly made this site to play around with Hugo and Github Pages.

But if you feel inclined, you can run this yourself using

```
go run github.com/geofpwhite/cube@latest
```
